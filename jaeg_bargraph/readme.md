#### About the App

**Version 0.0.1**

This app showcases what a `ggplot2` bar graph looks like and some of its functionalities. The app is made possible thanks to R packages such as `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, and `ggplot2`.

#### Data Source
The raw data comes from 11,187 records of lost and found animals from 1999 to 2007 and from 2009 to 2015 in the city of Vacouver in British Columbia, Canada. This open dataset was prepared by the Vancouver Animal Control Office. The final data was processed and cleaned by the authors of the app.
