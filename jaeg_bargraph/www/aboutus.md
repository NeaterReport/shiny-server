#### About the App

**Version 0.0.1**

This app showcases what a `ggplot2` bar graph looks like and some of its functionalities. The app is made possible thanks to R packages such as `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, and `ggplot2`.

#### Data Source
The raw data comes from a subset of records of 2,728 lost and found animals between 2011 and 2014 reported in the city of Vacouver in British Columbia, Canada. This open dataset was prepared by the Vancouver Animal Control Office. The final data was processed and cleaned by the authors of the app.
