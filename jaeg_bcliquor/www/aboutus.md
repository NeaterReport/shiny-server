#### About the App

**Version 0.0.1**

This is an shiny app to explore products sold at BC liquor Stores. Please drink and explore responsibly,  enjoy! The app is made possible thanks to R packages such as `leaflet`, `ggplot2`, `ggvis`, `shiny`, `shinydashboard`.

#### Data Source
The *BC Liquor Store Product Price List* data came from OpenDataBC ([download data here](https://www.opendatabc.ca/dataset/bc-liquor-store-product-price-list-current-prices)). The data contains the display price, alcohol content, and sweetness rating for 6,144 liquor products sold at the government liqour store in the Province of British Columbia, Canada.

#### Inspiration
This is one of many shiny apps dedicated to and inspired by **Emelie**.
