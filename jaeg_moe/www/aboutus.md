#### About the App

**Version 0.0.1.1**

The app calculates the margin of errors for proportion and mean, with or without correction for population size (i.e., finite population correction). The app main feature is the use of dynamic graphics to visualize how errors change as your sample size, standard deviation, or desired margin of errors change. The app is made possible thanks to various R packages - `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, and `ggplot2`.

#### Inspiration
This is one of many shiny apps dedicated to and inspired by **Emelie**.
