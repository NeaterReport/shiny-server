#### About the App

**Version 0.0.1.2**

The app calculates the margin of error for proportion and mean, with or without correction for population size (i.e., finite population correction). The app uses graphics to visualize how error or sample size change as your sample size, standard deviation, or desired margin of error change.

The app is made possible thanks to various R packages - `shiny`, `shinydashboard`, and `ggplot2`.

#### Inspiration
This is one of many shiny apps dedicated to and inspired by **Emelie**.
