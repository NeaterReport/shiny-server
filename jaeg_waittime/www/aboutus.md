#### About the App

**Version 0.0.1**

This is an shiny app to explore wait times for various treatments in Canada. The app is made possible thanks to R packages such as `ggplot2`, `shiny`, and `shinydashboard`.

#### Data Source
The *CIHI Wait Time* data came from the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI - [download data here](http://waittimes.cihi.ca)). The data shows the percentage of treatment cases in each province that met the benchmark wait time, as well as the number of days (or hours for hip fracture repair) where 50% and 90% of the patients waited before being treated.

#### Inspiration
This is one of many shiny apps dedicated to and inspired by **Emelie**.
